# A-star-Pathfinding-Visualization

Hello everyone,this is my first Python open source project and I hope that some programmers will contribute to this project
to improve teamwork and collaboration skills and further expand programming knowledge.


I attempt an implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the optimal path between two points in a 2D grid.

About the graphical User Interface (UI) I am thinking about using the pygame module.
